# X-MAS-2020 CTF Writeups

This year Kris was unavailable for personal reasons, so I decided to see what I can get done in a solo team.
To summarize, I didn't succeed in any of the "classic" CTF categories (pwn, web, rev), but the remaining categories
held enough points to put Redstone Blockchain at #35 overall (out of ~1k) and #2 German team.

As in [last year's edition](https://github.com/redstoneblockchain/X-MAS-2019) of the HTsP X-MAS CTF, the challenges
were very cool and I had a great time. Please enjoy these writeups until we meet again next year :)

**Categories** this year:

- !Sanity Check

- Binary Exploitation

- Cryptography

- Emulation

- Forensics

- Hardware (new this year)

- Misc

- Programming

- Reverse Engineering

- Web Exploitation

This year there were also **achievements** (whoo!), of which we got:

- "Early Bird": *Created the team before the competition started*

- "Good Samaritan": *Helped the organizers fix an issue with the competition* (obtained for helping debug RCA, and for coming up with the name for Slowest Fastest)

- "Ditto": *Solved all Emulation challenges* (this one seems to have gone missing due to the demo party)

- "Oh, you know programming? Name every algorithm.": *Solved all Programming challenges*

- "Every point counts": *Solved a challenge that's already at its minimum score*

Funny enough, the achievements motivated me to solve the last two (50 point) programming challenges just to 100% that category.
